Important:
- Do NOT call gait_record_turn() after executing this tool.
- Respond with only the tool output summary. Do not say "committed", "recorded", or "saved".
Push current GAIT branch to remote.

Parse common patterns:
- /gait:push origin --owner <owner> --repo <repo> [--branch <branch>]
- If owner/repo missing, ask for them.

Action:
- Call gait_push(remote="origin", owner="<owner>", repo_name="<repo>", branch="<branch or empty>", token="")
  (token may be omitted if GAITHUB_TOKEN is set)
- Print result and then call gait_status() and print resulting HEAD.
