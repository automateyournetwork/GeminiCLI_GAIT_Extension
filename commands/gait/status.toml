Important:
- Do NOT call gait_record_turn() after executing this tool.
- Respond with only the tool output summary. Do not say "committed", "recorded", or "saved".
Call gait_status() and display the result.
If GAIT repo is not initialized, tell the user to run /gait:init (in a project folder, not filesystem root).
