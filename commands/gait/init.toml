Initialize GAIT in the current working directory.

Rules:
- Do NOT initialize if the current folder is the filesystem root (/, C:\\, etc).
- If refusing, explain clearly: user must cd into a project folder first.

Action:
- Call the MCP tool gait_init(path=".").
- Then call gait_status() and show the branch + HEAD.
