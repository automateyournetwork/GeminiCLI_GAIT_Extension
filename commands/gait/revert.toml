name = "gait:revert"
description = "Revert GAIT HEAD to undo last tracked turn(s)"

prompt = """
Revert GAIT tracked context.

User intent:
- If user says just /gait:revert, revert the last recorded turn (HEAD~1).
- If user provides a target (like HEAD~2 or a short commit id), revert to that target.
- If user includes --also-memory, also rewind pinned memory.

Important clarification (tell user):
- This will NOT delete the visible transcript in Gemini-CLI.
- It WILL reset GAIT HEAD so the reverted turns are excluded from GAIT context going forward.

Action:
- Call gait_revert(target="<target or HEAD~1>", also_memory=<true/false>)
- Then call gait_status() and print new HEAD.
- Then say: "Continuing from reverted context."
