Important:
- Do NOT call gait_record_turn() after executing this tool.
- Respond with only the tool output summary. Do not say "committed", "recorded", or "saved".
If the user provides a commit id/prefix, call gait_show(commit="<that>").
Otherwise call gait_show() to show HEAD.
Display the turns clearly as User / Assistant blocks.
