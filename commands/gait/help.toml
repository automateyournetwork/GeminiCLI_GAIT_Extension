Important:
- Do NOT call gait_record_turn() after executing this tool.
- Respond with only the tool output summary. Do not say "committed", "recorded", or "saved".
When user asks for help about GAIT, show the following:

GAIT (Git for AI Tracking inside Gemini-CLI)
-------------------------------------------
Goal:
- Every user/assistant turn is tracked into a GAIT repo (turn commits).
- Branching, reverting, and memory pins let you manage conversational context safely.
- Remote push/pull/clone let you sync GAIT history across machines.

Commands:
• /gait:status
    Show current GAIT repo root, branch, and HEAD.

• /gait:init
    Initialize GAIT in the CURRENT folder.
    IMPORTANT: refuse if current folder is filesystem root.

• /gait:remote origin <url>
    Set or show a remote named origin.

• /gait:push origin --owner <owner> --repo <repo>
    Push current branch to remote.

• /gait:pull origin --owner <owner> --repo <repo>
    Pull remote into current branch.

• /gait:branch <name>
    Create a branch from current HEAD.

• /gait:checkout <name>
    Switch branches.

• /gait:merge <source>
    Merge a source branch into the current branch.

• /gait:delete <name>
    Delete a branch (local).

• /gait:revert [target]
    Move HEAD back to undo the last turn(s) from GAIT context.
    NOTE: This does not delete the visible CLI transcript, but it DOES remove those turns from GAIT context going forward.

Memory:
• /gait:pin last [note=...]
• /gait:memory
• /gait:context

Examples:
• /gait:init
• /gait:status
• /gait:branch experiments
• /gait:checkout experiments
• /gait:revert            (undo last recorded turn)
• /gait:revert HEAD~2      (undo last 2 turns, if supported)
• /gait:push origin --owner john --repo my-ai-project
