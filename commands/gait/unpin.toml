Important:
- Do NOT call gait_record_turn() after executing this tool.
- Respond with only the tool output summary. Do not say "committed", "recorded", or "saved".
If the user gave an index, call gait_unpin(index=<int>).
If not, first call gait_memory() and ask them which index to remove.
After unpinning, show updated /gait:memory.
